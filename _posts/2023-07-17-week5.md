This week was a little bit different as we had an HCC retreat all day Wednesday. On Monday I worked from Northeastern and met with one of Dr. Hofmanns PhD students who has worked on making study designs before to help get some direction. After that we had a ACT Lab meeting however this time it was just the students in the lab group meeting since Dr. Hofmann was gone travleing. After that we finished the day with an HCI meeting.

On Tuesday I worked from home and began going through the ten research papers I found last week and took notes on their approach to their study designs to get a better sense on how I could go about designing mine. 

On Wednesday we had the HCC retreat at Northeastern where I got to hear some lightning talks about other professors research at Northeastern. I also got the opportunity to meet some of these professors and do some networking which was really awesome.

On Thursday I worked from Northeastern and finished up my note taking on the research papers. I then had a one-on-one meeting with Dr. Hofmann where she helped me fix the racking problem with KnitScript I had the week prior and then we also discussed the next steps in creating a study design protocol. 

On Friday I worked from home instead of at MIT since Dr. Hofmann was gone hosting a HackAThon event that day. I mainly worked on completing some CITI training that I needed to do to be able to conduct a human subject research study.
