title: Week 7

This week I mainly worked on completing the IRB protocal, writng more code for stimming device protoypes and textures, and starting to fill out the consent forms for the study. On Monday, I worked from Northeastern and started the morning off by working on some coding and then we had an ACT Lab meeting where one of the PhD students presented on a systematic review study he's been working on which was pretty interesting to hear about. Then we finished the day with a HCC meeting about writing Systems papers.

On Tuesday, I worked from home and started working on writing the IRB protocol for the study and worked on writing more code for the stimming prototypes.

On Wednesday, I worked from home again and finished the IRB protocol and began looking over/filling out the the consent forms. 

On Thursday, I went into Northeastern and had a meeting with Dr. Hofmann to ask her about the IRB Protocol I wrote and to ask questions I had regarding the right language to use when filling out the consent forms. After that, I spent the rest of the day planning out a presentation about my research project so far for the following week.

On Friday, I worked from Northeastern and spent pretty much the whole day creating my powerpoint for the presenation. I also worked a little bit on a new approach to 3D machine knitting that I had.
