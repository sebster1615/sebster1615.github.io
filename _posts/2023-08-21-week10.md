This was a bit of a hectic week! On Monday I finished up the last touches on my 
presentation in the morning and then we all walked over to the HCC meeting
together where I was to give my presentation. The presentation went pretty well I
think and I was happy with the feedback that I got. 

On Tuesday I worked from home and began finishing up loose ends before I headed
back to the west coast. I worked on some emails and worked on a bit more code for
some of the prototype stimming designs. In the evening, I went to visit the JFK 
museum with my friend who was in town which was a ton of fun and very 
interesting!

On Wednesday, I worked from home again and began typing out my final report for
DREU. I also started packimg as I was leaving early Friday morning. 

On Thursday, I went into Northeastern University for the last time before I left
:(. In the morning, I worked some more on my final report and then in the 
afternoon I met with Dr. Hofmann. I had a great meeting with her where we 
dicussed the next steps for the project moving forward in the fall and 
concluding questions I had. 

On Friday I left very early in the morning at 6 am! I spent most the flight 
sleeping and finsihing up the final touches for my final report for DREU.
