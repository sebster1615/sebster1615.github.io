title: Week 8

The beginning of this week was a little bit wonky. I was supposed to give a presenation at the HCC meeting on Monday on my summer research project so far but I unfortunately woke up with some sort of a stomach bug that took me out both Monday and Tuesday so I had to reschedule my presentation for the last week of the program. 

On Wednesday, I worked from home and finished up the IRB forms and sent them into Dr. Hofmann for her to review. Then I began working on and thinking about the survey for the participants of the study to take before the study. I finished the day off working on some more coding and then went on a boat tour of the Boston harbor with my mom who came to visit!

On Thursday, I went into Northeastern and finished up my first draft of the presurvey before my meeting with Dr. Hofmann. During the meeting she helped review it and told me the types of questions I should ask. After that, I worked on more prototyping of possible stimming devices and then meet my mom at a very cool art museum across from Northeastern called the Isabella Gardner Musuem that was super interesting!

On Friday, I worked from home because Dr. Hofmann was gone on a trip. I finished up the edits she gave me during the meeting the day before for the presurvery and spent the rest of the day working on some 3D hand knitted prototypes since the knitting machines are still down. Friday night I went to my first Red Sox game which was a very fun experience!!
